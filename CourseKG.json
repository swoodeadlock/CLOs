Students will apply this foundation to learning the pathways of the 12 primary channels, the eight extraordinary meridians, the 15 luo collateral vessels, the 12 divergent channels, and the 12 muscle-sinew channels. In addition, students will be given a general introduction to acupuncture points, including their definition, general functions, and the major theoretical and functional point categories."
